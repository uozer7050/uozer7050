# ðŸ“Š Mini Data Science Introduction (MDSI)

Hello! Iâ€™m a researcher/developer passionate about data science and statistics. In my projects, I actively work with:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Statistical modeling**
- ðŸ¤– **Machine learning**
- ðŸ§¹ **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)**
- ðŸ§  **Prediction and classification algorithms**
- ðŸ“š **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), R, and SQL**

My goal is to extract meaningful insights from data and build decision support systems and predictive models. Iâ€™m especially focused on financial data analysis, credit scoring, and customer segmentation.

ðŸ“‚ I will be adding projects, notebooks, and annotated code here soon. Stay tuned!
